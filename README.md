# [INSERT NAME]'s Game

## Introduction
What originally started out as one typing game for a friend turned into 10 typing games for a bunch of friends for the holidays. Each game has its own game music, game over music, targets, and backgrounds. On top of that, a few games have unique visuals/mechanics specfic to that person's game. Might come back to this and add the ability for players to make their own games.

For most people this will seem like a very odd mashup of different things that dont quite make sense,  but I want to share this with whoever wants to try it out. For my buds who I built it for, I hope you guys like it. It was fun making this for you guys and even more enjoyable poking fun at everyone.

Merry Christmas!

(I do not know if the Mac build works as I do not have a machine to test it on)

## How to Play

- Type the words underneath the targets to prevent them from reaching you
- Get hit 5 times and its game over
- Change theme in the "Change Game" menu

### Hard Mode
- Hard mode makes the text underneath each target invisible. I highly recommened playing each theme a few times before attempting to play in Hard Mode

### Cap Sensitive
- Cap Sensitive requires that the input chars be the correct case in order to destroy targets

## Controls

- L-Shift: Move cursor to closest target
- L-Arrow: Move cursor to the closest target to the left of the current target
- R-Arrow: Move cursor to the closest target to the right of the current target

### Special Controls (only available in one game. No spoilers)
- L-Ctrl: Buy Health
